    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Move oven rack to low-center and preheat to 400F, Press one pie pastry into each of 2 9 inch deep dish pie pans, save remaining pastry until end</li>
        <li>Combine broth and evaporated milk in a microwave-safe bowl; microwave on high until steamy, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>At the same time, heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onions and celery; saut√© until just tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in the Dutch oven over medium heat. Whisk in flour and thyme, and cook until golden, about 1 minute. Whisk in hot milk mixture and bring to a simmer. Continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Remove the Dutch oven from the heat. Stir in wine, salt, and pepper. Add onion mixture, shredded chicken, frozen vegetables, and parsley; stir until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>Divide chicken mixture between the prepared pie pans. Place remaining pastries over top, and flute the edges by pinching with your fingers. Place both pie pans onto a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pastries are golden brown and filling is bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
